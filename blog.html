								<h1>SUCCESFUL REPAIR OF THE MX-1 SAT</h1>
								<span>FEBRUARY 6, 2023</span>
								<p>When satellites are launched into space, their lifespan is typically tied to the amount of fuel they have on board. Once they run through those reserves, they can no longer re-position themselves into a useful orbit, and so they are typically left to float freely as space junk. There have been widespread calls to come up with a solution for this problem, as discarded satellites are taking up valuable space in orbit, and could potentially cause a collision as things get more crowded.
								<p>After launch sometime in 2020, each of Effective Space’s drones will latch on to a satellite and take over the job of re-positioning it, allowing the satellites to remain active for several years beyond their expected end of life..</p>

								<h1>ALIEN SIGNAL DISCOVERY</h1>
								<span>FEBRUARY 3, 2023</span>
								<p>Since 2007, telescopes have continuously picked up a strange, sporadic signal which originates from three billion lightyears away.The strange and rare signals are what as known as ‘fast radio bursts’ or FRBs but scientists are still unsure what causes them</p>
								<p>However, what they do know is that they can emit as much energy in a second than the sun does in 10,000 years.They are exceptionally difficult to study as they can last as little as a millisecond and there is no way to predict when they are coming..</p>
